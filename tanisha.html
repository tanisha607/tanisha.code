      <h1><b>ABOUT US</b></h1><br>NavGurukul Himachal Campus is dedicated to providing quality education
       to BCA students through a self-study based approach.
       Our campus, in collaboration with Eternal University, aims to create a conducive learning environment for students. 
       NavGurukul is a non-profit organization based in India that focuses on providing affordable and 
       high-quality education in the field of software engineering to underprivileged youth.

                NavGurukul aims to bridge the gap between education and employment by providing intensive training programs that equip students with the necessary skills to secure jobs in the tech industry. 
                The organization believes in the transformative power of education to uplift individuals and communities.
                
            
                NavGurukul offers a one-year residential program where students, primarily from underserved backgrounds, receive comprehensive training in software development.
                 The curriculum is designed to be rigorous and industry-relevant, covering topics such as coding, data structures, algorithms, web development, and more.
                
            
                A distinctive feature of NavGurukul's education model is its emphasis on self-learning and peer-to-peer education. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their learning journey,
                 collaborate with peers, and develop problem-solving skills. This approach fosters independence and a deeper understanding of the material.</h1>
